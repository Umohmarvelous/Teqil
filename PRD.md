## 1. What we are building

EMILGO (repo name **Teqil**, bundle id `com.teqil.app`) is a mobile app for
**Nigerian commercial road transport** — the danfo/bus/keke economy. It connects
three parties who today coordinate by shouting, cash and phone calls:

| Role | What they need |
|---|---|
| **Driver** | Fill seats, get paid without handling cash, prove they're legitimate, earn rewards for good service |
| **Passenger** | Find a trip going their way, know the fare up front, pay without cash, feel safe about who is driving |
| **Park owner** | See which of their drivers are working, respond to emergencies, verify driver identity |

The product thesis: **trust and payment are the bottleneck, not matching.** Nigerian
commercial transport already has abundant supply and demand meeting physically at
parks. What's missing is a way to (a) verify the driver is who they claim, (b) move
money without cash, and (c) create a reason for drivers to behave well repeatedly.
Everything in the app serves one of those three.

### Currency, language, market

- All money is **Naira (₦)**. `formatNaira` in `src/utils/helpers`.
- Two languages: **English** and **Nigerian Pidgin** (`src/i18n/`). Pidgin is a
  first-class locale, not a novelty — a large share of the target users read it
  more comfortably than English.
- Brand green `#009A43` (`Colors.primary`), gold `#F5A623` (`Colors.gold`) for
  earnings and coin UI. Font is **Poppins** throughout.

## 2. Core domain concepts

Read this section before touching business logic — several of these are
non-obvious and easy to get wrong.

### Trips and trip codes
A driver creates a trip; the system issues a short **trip code**. Passengers join
by scanning the driver's QR or entering the code. `live-trip-code/[code].tsx`
renders a live-tracked trip. Trip state lives in `useTripStore` (not persisted —
it is reset per trip by design).

### Fuel coins
The driver reward currency. Earned by completing trips, convertible to Naira
(`coinsToNaira`). Displayed in gold. This is the retention mechanic — it is why a
driver keeps using the app rather than reverting to cash.

### The QR money model
**Non-obvious and previously got this wrong.** On a QR fare payment
(`app/(passenger)/payment.tsx`): the passenger pays **half** the fare, the driver
receives **that half plus a ₦100 bonus**. The bonus is subsidised from the pool.
Home-screen scan routes to `payment.tsx`, not to the generic pay-fare flow.

### Barter / bargaining
Nigerian transport fares are negotiated, not fixed. A passenger can counter-offer
a driver's price; the driver accepts, rejects or counters. Backed by
`supabase/migrations/migration_barter_bargaining.sql`. Route: `app/barter/[offerId].tsx`.

### Free rides
A promotional mechanic where a rider's fare is covered. Completion is tracked
server-side (`migration_free_ride_completion.sql`) so it can't be spoofed
client-side. **Free rides always track location**, regardless of the user's
share-location setting — that's the deal for a subsidised ride, and it is stated
in the settings copy.

### Loyalty tiers
Free / Pro / Elite (`app/tiers.tsx`). Gates premium features.
**Revenue persistence for tiers is still outstanding.**

### Credit tiers (distinct from loyalty tiers)
Bronze / Silver / Gold, derived from completed trips. Shown as a profile badge.
A user can hide the badge; hiding it does not change the tier.

## 3. Architecture

### Offline-first is the defining constraint
Nigerian mobile data is intermittent. **AsyncStorage is the source of truth for
reads; Supabase is the sync target.** Never write a screen that assumes the
network is up.

`src/services/sync.ts` implements this explicitly:
- **Push** — local records with `synced = false` are upserted to Supabase, then marked synced.
- **Pull** — remote records for the current user merge into local storage,
  last-write-wins on `updated_at`, remote wins ties.
- Triggered from `app/_layout.tsx`: on user change, on connectivity change, and
  manually. The sync layer is plain functions with no React dependency — it is
  wired to the lifecycle only at the call site. Keep it that way.

### Two backends exist; only one is wired up

- **`server/` — ACTIVE.** Small Express app, port 5001 (`PORT` to override).
  Serves the Expo web build and exposes exactly two routes today
  (`server/routes.ts`): `/api/health` and `/api/webhooks/scan-success`
  (Expo push). This is the only HTTP backend the app reaches.
- **`services/` + `gateway/` + `docker-compose.yml` — NOT INTEGRATED.**
  A DDD-style microservice split (auth, trip, payment, engagement, ad-analytics,
  notification, credits) behind an nginx gateway. Buildable, but the app does not
  call it. Treat as in-progress backend work, not the live API surface.

The mobile app talks **directly to Supabase** for auth and data via
`src/services/supabase.ts`.

### State
Zustand, in `src/store/`:
- `useStore.ts` — `useAuthStore` (user/session/role/language, persisted) and
  `useTripStore` (live trip: location, earnings, elapsed, route coords; not persisted)
- `useSettingsStore.ts` — theme and all user preferences; `ThemeSync` in the root layout keeps it in step with the OS
- `useMessagesStore.ts`, `useCreditsStore.ts`

TanStack Query (`lib/query-client.ts`) exists but most domain state still flows
through Zustand + the sync layer.

### Routing (expo-router, file-based)
- `(auth)/` — welcome/role-select, login, register, driver-profile
- `(main)/` — shared tab shell: home, discover, feed, messages, profile, settings
- `(driver)/`, `(passenger)/`, `(park-owner)/` — role-specific
- Top-level dynamic/modal routes: `live-trip-code/[code]`, `direct-chat/[conversationId]`, `barter/[offerId]`, `rating`

`app/_layout.tsx` is the composition root: fonts, Supabase auth subscription,
i18n, push tokens, connectivity-triggered sync, and the animated splash gating
first paint.

### Directory split
- `app/` — routes only
- `components/` — shared UI across route groups
  - `components/ios/` — **the iOS design-system kit** (see §4)
  - `components/Sidedbar.tsx` — filename typo, kept deliberately. Don't "fix" it without checking every import.
- `src/` — everything non-route: `services/`, `store/`, `models/types.ts`, `i18n/`, `hooks/`, `data/`, `utils/`

`@/*` maps to the repo root. Existing code mixes `@/` and relative imports —
follow whatever the file you're editing already does.

---

## 4. The iOS design system (`components/ios/`)

The app targets **iOS 26 Liquid Glass**. This is the most opinionated part of the
codebase and the easiest to break.

### The rendering ladder
`Glass` (`components/ios/Glass.tsx`) resolves to one of four paths:

1. **iOS 26 + native module** → real `UIGlassEffect` via `expo-glass-effect`
2. **iOS 25 and below, or Expo Go** → `expo-blur` + the caller's material tint
3. **Android / web** → `expo-blur` (weaker) + a heavier veil
4. **Reduce Transparency on** → flat opaque surface, no blur

Every caller passes `fallbackTint` — the exact colour the design used before
glass existed. That is why paths 2–4 are not visible downgrades.

### Rules that will bite you

**Never animate opacity on a `GlassView` or any of its ancestors.** It renders
the effect incorrectly (expo/expo#41024; Apple says the same about
`UIVisualEffectView.alpha`). This has been fixed across the kit nine times and
will keep recurring. The pattern:
- containers animate **motion only** (scale, translate)
- glass materialises via the `present` prop, which animates the *effect*
- content drawn **on top of** glass may fade freely

**Glass clips its children**, so a clipped view can't cast a shadow. Cards with
shadows put the shadow on a wrapper and the glass inside.

**Translucent chrome needs content behind it.** If a scroll view's *frame* is
padded away from the header/tab bar, the glass has nothing to sample and renders
as a flat panel. Use **content insets**, never frame padding — `useCollapsibleScroll`
returns `scrollProps` that does this correctly.

**`isInteractive` only applies on mount.** Remount with a new `key` to change it.

**Capability detection is defensive.** `isLiquidGlassAvailable()` throws when the
native module is absent (Expo Go), and some iOS 26 betas report the new design but
crash on the API — hence the `isGlassEffectAPIAvailable()` second check.

### Two type ramps
- `IOSFont` — San Francisco, for **system chrome** (alerts, menus, nav bars) where matching iOS exactly is the point
- `IOSAppFont` — **Poppins**, for app UI (settings rows, cards, buttons)

### Kit inventory
`Glass`, `GlassGroup`, `GlassScrim`, `IOSButton`, `IOSToggle`, `IOSSheet`,
`IOSModalCard`, `IOSAlert`, `IOSMenu`, `IOSSearchBar`, `IOSSearchOverlay`,
`IOSFilterChips`, `IOSSegmentedTabs`, `SwipeableTabs`, `IOSList`, `IOSScreen`,
`IOSTabBar`, `CollapsibleHeader`, `NetworkStatus`, `RatingModal`,
`FeedbackModal`, `AlertHost`.

Three of these carry decisions worth knowing before you change them:

- **`IOSSegmentedTabs`** has two variants. `underline` reads as one control with
  square inner edges. `capsule` is the iOS 26 segmented control: a glass track
  with a smaller glass thumb that springs between segments. The thumb is a real
  second glass surface, not a tinted View, so it refracts the background exactly
  as the system control does — and it animates on `transform` only.
- **`SwipeableTabs`** pins its strip with a scroll-driven overlay rather than
  `stickyHeaderIndices`, because sticky headers pin at the top of the scroll
  viewport, which is behind the pinned bar; the strip would slide under it and
  disappear. iOS could be told otherwise via `contentInset`, Android could not.
- **`IOSSearchOverlay`** presents with `animationType="slide"`, never `"fade"` —
  a fade animates the modal's alpha, and this surface is full of glass.

**`/ui-kit`** is a live gallery of every component, with a banner reporting which
rendering path the device is on. Not linked from navigation — open it directly.

## 5. Current state — what is built

### Working
- Auth (Supabase), role selection, registration, driver profile completion
- Offline-first sync with conflict resolution
- Trip creation, trip codes, QR generate/scan, live GPS tracking with a real map
- GPS route history (`migration_route_history.sql`), Douglas–Peucker simplification
- Fare payment (Paystack), the QR half-fare + ₦100 bonus model
- Barter/bargaining
- Free rides with server-side completion
- Fuel coins, credit tiers, loyalty tiers page
- Biometric app lock, session timeout
- i18n (English + Pidgin)
- Push notifications
- Discover feed with comments, replies and a composer
- iOS kit with Liquid Glass across the control layer
- **41 of 56 screens migrated to the kit**

### Known gaps and debt
- **`direct-chat`** now works, but message state is screen-local. If chat needs to
  drive unread badges elsewhere, it needs a store.
- **`services/` microservices** are unintegrated.
- **`src/db/`** is empty/unused.
- **Loyalty tier revenue persistence** is not implemented.
- **Park-owner alerts use `MOCK_ALERTS`** — not wired to Supabase realtime yet.
- **`driver-search` filter/sort chips don't filter.** The lookup is an exact
  badge-ID match returning at most one driver. Commented in the code.
- Pre-existing unused-variable warnings in `(driver)/history.tsx` and `(main)/messages.tsx`.
- No test suite.

## 6. Roadmap — the 8 phases

Requested 2026-08-11. Strict phase order.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Collapsible headers on every scrollable screen (title left/large → centred/small, glass on scroll). WhatsApp-style profile header. | **Done.** 16 screens converted. The park-owner dashboard took a different shape on purpose — its gradient hero IS its header, so it got a compact glass bar that takes over on scroll instead of a second title. Profile header: the bar pins and cross-fades; the continuous travelling avatar is still outstanding. |
| **2** | Translucent tab bar with content scrolling behind it, correct safe-area insets, no clipping. | **Done** — `useCollapsibleScroll({ tabBar: true })` supplies both insets in one bundle so a screen cannot apply the top one and forget the bottom. |
| **3** | Replace the full-width network banner with a centred header status. | **Done.** `components/ios/NetworkStatus.tsx`, wired into the home header's centre slot. `useConnectionQuality` exported separately so the sync layer can share the signal. |
| **4** | Profile restructure: swipeable tabs; Account Settings under Profile; pull-to-refresh; tab bar pins on scroll with blur, stays swipeable. | **Done, then redesigned.** Three panes inside `app/(main)/profile.tsx` — Profile / Account Settings / Activity — via `SwipeableTabs`, now with a capsule glass tab strip, a bar pinned above everything carrying search/QR/sign-out, and full-screen search covering all three panes (`src/data/profileSearchIndex.ts`). Gear icon removed; settings screens under `app/settings/` untouched. |
| **5** | New **Notification** tab replaces the Settings tab. | **Done.** `app/(main)/notifications.tsx`, iOS-grouped (Today/Yesterday/This Week/Earlier). Currently sourced only from unread conversations — sync and system notices need the push/sync layers to report into a store. |
| **6** | Followers/following. Passengers follow drivers; driver profiles show follower and following counts; follow/unfollow toggle; follower list. Scalable social-graph schema. | **Done** — `follows` with a composite PK, trigger-maintained counters on `users`, and SECURITY DEFINER RPCs for the lists (RLS makes `users` own-row only, so a follower list cannot be a plain select). **`supabase/migrations/migration_follows.sql` must be run once**; until then the client degrades to no-ops. |
| **7** | Proximity: **Fastest Finger** (driver offers an immediate discounted ride, nearby passengers accept instantly); **Find driver/passenger near you** wired into bargaining and ride requests; **Find nearest filling station**. | **Done.** `app/nearby.tsx` — three panes on one location fix. `user_presence` + `fastest_finger_offers`/`_claims`, bounding-box + haversine (no PostGIS), seat race resolved by a guarded `UPDATE`. Stations from Overpass — free, keyless, verified against Lagos. Presence publishes off the location tracker's existing throttle. `migration_proximity.sql` applied and verified. |
| **Messaging** | Passenger↔driver chat: find by @username or driver ID, text + voice notes, driver replies, offline-first, call a contact. | **Working, verified end-to-end between two accounts under RLS.** Chat had never worked: `conversations` had RLS with zero policies, `messages` was a different table than the app writes (no `audio_uri` at all), conversation ids were typed `uuid` against the app's `direct_<uuid>_<uuid>` keys, and rows described only one side so recipients saw a chat with themselves. See HANDOFF §8. Realtime now delivers the first message of a brand-new chat (it used to drop it, so a chat someone else started needed a manual refresh), the driver inbox shows real conversations rather than only park broadcasts, and both swipe rows use the kit's `SwipeableRow`. **Call** resolves the number at press time via `get_contact_phone` — one number, only between people who already share a conversation, only while the owner allows it, never across a block; `migration_contact_phone.sql` must be applied first. |
| **Social feed** | A real social feed on the For You tab: posts with images and video, replies in a Twitter-style thread, reposts, quotes, likes, bookmarks with collections, polls, hashtags, mentions, follow from a card, blocks, mutes, reports, view counts, and promoted units. | **Built, database verified (28/29 e2e checks under RLS), UI not yet exercised on device.** `migration_social_feed.sql` — 12 tables, 39 functions, a `post-media` storage bucket whose policy pins each upload under the uploader's own id. Posts are stored normalised in `useFeedStore` (one copy per id; timelines are lists of ids), so liking a post in a thread updates the same post in the timeline, the profile tab and search. Replaces the old `feed.tsx`, which was a news reader fetching `/api/feed`. Ads are real code with an empty table — see SETUP-KEYS §4.4. |
| **Rewarded ads** | Watch ads, earn into your fuel pool. A daily milestone ladder, a streak with monthly freezes, an ad player with a progress timer, a forfeit warning on early close, a "not interested" reaction, a post-roll app-install carousel, and an ads settings screen (personalisation, sound, Wi-Fi-only video, muted categories, reminders). | **Built, applied and verified 27/27 under RLS.** Every payout decision is in the database: `start_ad_session` stamps the start from the server clock and `complete_ad_session` compares it to the server's `now()`, so a patched client gets the same answer as an honest one. Settling twice does not pay twice; cooldowns, daily ceilings and per-creative caps hold. `ad_creatives` is EMPTY, so the feature correctly reports no inventory — see SETUP-KEYS §4.4. **The seeded payouts are a deliberate subsidy, not a revenue share — SETUP-KEYS §4.6.** |
| **Ad partners** | A console for entering advertisers and their creatives, with live impressions, completions, clicks and spend, and automatic stop-out when a partner's budget is exhausted. | **Built, admin only, verified 13/13.** `is_admin` is checked in the database by every RPC, and cannot be granted from a client — the guard trigger is SECURITY INVOKER precisely so `current_user` is the caller rather than the owner. Reachable at Settings → Ads → Ad console. |
| **8** | Persistent watermark overlay so screenshots carry the logo; shareable profile deep link; rating/feedback modal. | Partly done — `RatingModal` (Twitter-style alert, 4–5★ → store, 1–3★ → feedback form) already ships. |

### Screens deliberately excluded from Phase 1

A collapsing large title is for scrolling LISTS. These are not, and forcing one
on them makes them worse:

- **Keyboard forms with sticky footers** — `driver/payout-bank`, `checkout`,
  `(auth)/register`, `(auth)/driver-profile`, `driver/create-trip`. The title
  collapses as the keyboard shoves content around.
- **`(main)` tab screens** — home, discover, feed, messages. The tab shell in
  `app/(main)/_layout.tsx` already draws their header; adding IOSScreen would
  double it.
- **Chat, maps, carousels, modals** — `direct-chat`, `live-trip-code/[code]`,
  `(auth)/welcome`, `rating`, `ui-kit`, `route-history/[id]` (the floating glass
  back button over the map is the right chrome; a title bar would cover the
  route).
- **Screens that are really modal content** — `(passenger)/find-driver` is
  imported and rendered by `components/FindDriverModal.tsx`. A large-title nav
  bar inside a bottom sheet is wrong.
- **Full-bleed branded surfaces** — `(passenger)/pay-fare`. Its white-on-green
  header is part of the artwork.
- **Screens that are already the modern chrome** — `driver-search` is a
  Spotlight-style expanding search field with no title to collapse.
- **Wizards** — `program`. The progress bar under the header must never scroll
  away, or the user loses their place in the flow.

### Decisions taken on the roadmap (2026-08-11)

- **Settings MOVED into Profile — nothing deleted.** (Revised by the user after an
  initial instruction to flatten.) The seven screens under `app/settings/` are
  untouched and still own their content. Only the root moved: `app/account-settings.tsx`
  replaces the old `app/(main)/settings.tsx`, reached from a gear in Profile's
  action pill, with the same search over `src/data/settingsIndex.ts`. The
  **Notification** tab took the Settings tab's slot.
- **Two different problems, only one needs a key.**
  *Finding nearby drivers/passengers needs no third-party API at all* — they are
  rows in our own Supabase table, so it is a lat/lng radius query. This is how
  Bolt works: they query their own fleet, not a maps provider.
  *Filling stations* are external POI data and do need a source. The user will
  supply a Google Places key (server-side, via a new Express endpoint).
  **OpenStreetMap's Overpass API is a free, keyless, no-billing alternative**
  with usable Nigerian fuel-station coverage, and is worth trying first.
- **Screenshot watermarking:** iOS cannot modify the image the system saves to
  Photos, so the approach is a **persistent faint logo overlay** rendered in a
  corner of every screen; any screenshot naturally includes it.

> Last verified state: 2026-08-13, branch `sdk-54-temp`, commit `880efc3`.
> Typecheck 0 errors, iOS bundle exports clean.

## 7. Environment and build

> **Keys, accounts and manual setup live in [SETUP-KEYS.md](SETUP-KEYS.md).**
> Read it before treating any of these as finished: Paystack is on **test keys**
> (no real money moves), KYC runs in **mock mode** (anyone can become a verified
> partner), and push has no `projectId`. All three degrade silently rather than
> failing, so they demo perfectly and are not production.

### Commands
```bash
npx expo start          # Metro
npm run expo:dev        # Metro wired for Replit's proxy domain
npm run expo:remote     # Cloudflare-tunnelled Metro + API for remote testers
npm run server:dev      # Express API alone, port 5001
npm run server:build    # esbuild → server_dist/
npm run lint
```
No test suite is configured.

### SDK situation — read this before debugging a build
`main` is on **Expo SDK 57**. Branch **`sdk-54-temp`** is a deliberate, temporary
downgrade to SDK 54 so the app runs in Expo Go on a real iPhone while the dev
build is blocked on Apple provisioning.

On SDK 54, two things differ and are already handled on that branch:
- `expo-status-bar` has no config plugin before SDK 57 — it must not appear in
  `app.json` `plugins`.
- `babel-preset-expo` installs nested rather than hoisted, so it's declared
  explicitly in `devDependencies`.

`expo-glass-effect` 0.1.10 (SDK 54) and 57.0.1 have **identical APIs**, so the
whole kit compiles on both.

To return to 57: `git checkout main && npm install`.

**You will not see real Liquid Glass in Expo Go** — it needs iOS 26 *and* the
native module in the binary. Expo Go shows the blur fallback. That is correct
behaviour, not a bug.

### npm gotcha
`ETARGET / no matching version` on an Expo package here almost always means a
**stale npm cache**, not a real conflict — verify with `npm view <pkg> versions`
first. Fix: `npm cache clean --force && npm install`. `--prefer-online` is not
enough; it refreshes the top-level packument but still serves stale ones for
transitive deps.

### Secrets
`EXPO_PUBLIC_*` is inlined into the bundle at build time — **never put a secret
there**. Paystack/Smile/ads and the forthcoming Google Places key are
server-side only. Test keys work now; live keys need provider verification.

### Premium kill-switch
`src/config/devFlags.ts`. `DEV_OVERRIDES_ENABLED = __DEV__`, so it is dead-code
eliminated in production. **It deliberately has no UI** — a user-facing toggle
would let anyone switch premium on.

---

## 8. Working agreements

- Nigerian transport reality beats generic ride-hailing assumptions. Fares are
  negotiated; connectivity is intermittent; cash is what we're replacing.
- **Never fund the pool with fake data.** Verify Supabase RPCs in rolled-back
  transactions.
- When migrating a screen to the kit: **swap components, preserve layout**. The
  original design is deliberate.
- Commit and push each meaningful unit of work.
