# Teqil - Nigerian Commercial Transport App

## Overview
Teqil is a mobile app for Nigerian commercial drivers, passengers, and park owners. Drivers earn fuel coins by staying on live trips, passengers join trips using unique codes and get live tracking, and park owners monitor operations.

- **Backend**: Express.js server (port 5000) with landing page
- **State**: Zustand (persisted with AsyncStorage)
- **Database**: AsyncStorage for local persistence, Supabase for cloud sync (optional)
- **i18n**: i18next with English + Nigerian Pidgin
